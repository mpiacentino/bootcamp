    "Keeping track of all of the changes in your project over time is good practice.  How many times have you edited something in something you were writing and then wanted to go back and see what you had in the first place?  Wouldn't it be great to know what changes you made and when you made them?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **version control system** facilitates this process of keeping track of changes over time.  Beyond that, it allows multiple people to collaborate and work on parts of the same project simultaneously. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many version control systems.  The four most prominent, in order of age, are CVS, Subversion, Git, and Mercurial (the first version of Git was released about two weeks before Mercurial, so they are really the same age).  Today, Git and Mercurial seem to dominate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Git was developed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), the person who developed the Linux operating system.  He named Linux after himself, and he decided to also name Git after himself (\"git\" is British slang for a stupid person).  Try typing\n",
    "\n",
    "    man git\n",
    "    \n",
    "and read what the `NAME` of the software is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Git as a version control system allows communication with remote repositories such as [GitHub](http://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](http://bitbucket.org). Both services provide univesity-affiliated people with a `.edu` email address with perks that include a number of private repositories ([Github](https://education.github.com/pack) and [Bitbucket](https://blog.bitbucket.org/2012/08/20/bitbucket-academic/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Remote repositories are not only a great way for keeping your data safe. They are also an excellent tool for collaboration since Git allows multiple users to edit the shared files simultaneously and has a method to merge changes afterwards.  Public repositories can also serve as a vehicle to distribute code (or other files). "

When working on an implementation, split features into multiple logical chunks, e.g. different functions, test them individually, and commit with descriptive messages in stages.
