    "Ken Thompson of Bell Labs developed the first shell for UNIX called V6 in 1971. In 1977, Stephen Bourne introduced the Bourne shell (`sh`) which added the ability to invoke scripts (small reusable programs) from within the shell. The Bourne shell remains relevant. In some cases it's still the default root shell. Shortly afterwards, the C shell (`csh`) was developed which made use of a C-like scripting language. `tcsh` is built on `csh` and is still very common. `bash`, the Bourne again shell was developed by Brian Fox to replace the Bourne shell. It adds many useful features to sh and is the default shell on Macs and several Linux distributions. \n",
    "The Z shell (`zsh`) combines useful features from a number of shells and is worth checking out. Since it usually requires installation, we will stick with `bash` probably the most commonly used shell, for this lesson."
