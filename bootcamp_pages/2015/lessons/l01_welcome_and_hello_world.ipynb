    "We are at an interesting point in Python's history.  Python is currently in version 3.5 (as of September 13, 2015). The problem is that Python 3.x is not backwards compatible with Python 2.x.  Many scientific packages were written in Python 2.x and have been very slow to update to Python 3.  However, Python 3 is Python's present and future, so all packages eventually need to work in Python 3.  Today, most important scientific packages work in Python 3.  All of the packages we will use do, so we will use Python 3 in this course."

In his original, the printed text was \"`hello, world`\" (no period or capital `H`), but people use lots of variants.\n",
