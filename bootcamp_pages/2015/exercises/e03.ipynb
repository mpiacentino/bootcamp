It is therefore useful to have a Python 2 distribution available if you want or need it.  `conda` makes this easy!  Follow the instructions in [Lesson 18](../lessons/l18_more_command_line.html#conda) to set up a Python 2 environment."

Specifically, the protein MEX-5 has a gradient in concentration from the anterior to the posterior part of the cytoplasm.  An image of this is shown below, taken from Fig. 1 of [Griffin, et al., *Cell*, **146**, 955-968, 2011](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867411009354).\n",

The anterior-to-posterior distance is 50 µm.\n",

In this problem, we not going to invstigate mechanism, but are interested in whether or not retarded diffusion can account for concentration gradients.  To answer this question, we will computationally perform random walks in the cytoplasm in which the step length changes depending on the position within the cell."

Having 100,000 molecules in a *C. elegans* zygote amounts to a concentration of tens of nanomolar, a reaonsable physiological concentration.  We we take the diffusion coefficient to be 1 µm$^2$/s, we can take steps of size $\\delta = 1$ µm with $\\tau = 1$ second.  The time scale of the formation of the MEX-5 gradient is about 1000 seconds, or about 15 minutes.  The actual \"steps\" due to bombardment of the molecule with solvent are far shorter in distance and time, but, as we can derive from the fundamental physics, we can model the random walk as longer steps with a longer time interval."
