    "In this problem, we will write a function that takes an RNA sequence and an RNA secondary structure and decides if the secondary structure is possible given the sequence.  Remember, single stranded RNA can fold back on itself and form base pairs.  An RNA secondary structure is simply the list of base pairs that are present.  We will represent the base pairs in dot-parentheses notation.  For example, a sequence/secondary structure pair would be\n",

Base `1` pairs with base `8`, and base `2` pairs with base `7`.  Bases `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` are unpaired.  (This structure is aptly called a \"hairpin.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope the dot-parentheses notation is clear.  An open parenthesis is paired with the parenthesis that closes it.  Dots are unpaired.\n",
