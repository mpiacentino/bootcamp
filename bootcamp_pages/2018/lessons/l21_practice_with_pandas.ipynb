    "**c)** And now, finally.... Compute a `DataFrame` that has the mean, median, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation of the impact forces and adhesive forces for each frog. After you make this `DataFrame`, you might want to explore using the `pd.melt()` function to make it tidy. You can read [the documentation](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.melt.html) and/or ask a TA to help you."
