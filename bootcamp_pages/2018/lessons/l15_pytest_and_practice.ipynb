    "\n",
    "To explore another feature of `pytest`, we'll consider another aspect of our `number_negatives()` function.  Specifically, what should we do if an invalid sequence is entered? A sensible thing to do in this case is to make our software throw a `RuntimeError`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Again, in designing our test, we need to think about what constitutes an invalid sequence.  We'll only allow the 20 symbols for the residues that we used in [previous lessons](l13_exceptions_and_error_handling.html#Checking-input) and present in the `bootcamp_utils.aa` dictionary.  So, we adjust our test function accordingly.  We cannot use the **`assert`** statement to check for proper error handling, so we use the `pytest.raises()` function.  This function takes as its first argument the type of exception expected, and a string containing the code to be run to give the exception."

    "* We should use **assertions** to make sure the function operates as expected for given input.\n",

    "We should then add to the code of the `test_seq_features.py` to include our expectation that the program should throw a `RuntimeError` if an invalid sequence is entered:\n",

    "\n",
    "As we are building modules and functions, we are not able to anticipate all the functionalities they must have. And by adding new functionalities, we might need to change our code substantially and even dramatically change the initial logic that worked so well up to this point. This is so common in programming that developers have a name for it: **code refactoring**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we did not anticipate when we start writing `seq_features` that we also wanted to calculate the positive charges as well. And now that we have two functions we broke one of the most important rule in programming: **functions must do one thing and only one thing very well**. It is clear that `number_negatives()` was doing three things:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dealing with lowercases characters.  \n",
    "2. Raising exceptions for invalid amino-acids in the input sequence.  \n",
    "3. Calculating the negative charge of amino-acids.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Turns out that `number_positives()` also needs to do items 1 and 2, and because of that we have repeated the following lines of code in two different functions, within the same module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "   # Convert sequence to upper case\n",
    "    seq = seq.upper()\n",

    "            raise RuntimeError(aa + ' is not a valid amino acid.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and if we are trying to make this module more robust, every time we catch a bug, we will need to change identical code in **two places**. So let's perform a code refactoring in order to keep the principle of *functions doing only one thing* as close to the truth as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task, changing the inputted sequence to uppercase, uses a built-in Python function, and using another function to do this is unnessary. So, we can keep the `seq = seq.upper()` line in the functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's write a functions that will check if the sequence is valid. That way we will focus all the logic related to checking for invalid sequence in one part of the code, and we can call it anywhere we need afterwards. So, your module `seq_features.py` should look like this:\n",
