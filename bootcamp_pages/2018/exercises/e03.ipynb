    "## Exercise 3.2: Long-term trends in hybridization of Darwin finches\n",
    "\n",
    "[Peter and Rosemary Grant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Rosemary_Grant) have been working on the GalÃ¡pagos island of Daphne Major for over forty years.  During this time, they have collected lots and lots of data about physiological features of finches.  In 2014, they published a book with a summary of some of their major results (Grant P. R., Grant B. R., *40 years of evolution. Darwin's finches on Daphne Major Island*, Princeton University Press, 2014). They made their data from the book publicly available via the [Dryad Digital Repository](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.g6g3h).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will investigate their measurements of beak depth (the distance, top to bottom, of a closed beak) and beak length (base to tip on the top) of Darwin's finches.  We will look at data from two species, *Geospiza fortis* and *Geospiza scandens*.  The Grants provided data on the finches of Daphne for the years 1973, 1975, 1987, 1991, and 2012.  I have included the data in the files `grant_1973.csv`, `grant_1975.csv`, `grant_1987.csv`, `grant_1991.csv`, and  `grant_2012.csv`. They are in almost exactly the same format is in the Dryad repository; I have only deleted blank entries at the end of the files.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: If you want to skip the wrangling (which is very valuable experience), you can go directly to part (d). You can load in the `DataFrame` you generate in parts (a) through (c) from the file `~/git/bootcamp/data/grant_complete.csv`."

    "**c)** The `band` field gives the number of the band on the bird's leg that was used to tag it.  Are some birds counted twice?  Are they counted twice in the same year?  Do you think you should drop duplicate birds from the same year?  How about different years?  My opinion is that you should drop duplicate birds from the same year and keep the others, but I would be open to discussion on that.  To practice your Pandas skills, though, let's delete only duplicate birds from the same year from the `DataFrame`.  When you have made this `DataFrame`, save it as a CSV file.\n",

Since the indices are uninformative, you should use the `index=False` kwarg. (I have already done this and saved it as `~/git/bootcamp/data/grant_complete.csv`, which will help you do the rest of the exercise if you have problems with this part.)"

Describe what you see.  Do you see the changes in the differences between species (presumably as a result of introgressive hybridization)?
