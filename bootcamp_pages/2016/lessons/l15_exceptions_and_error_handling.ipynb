You may wish to check that the amino acid sequence is legitimate.  In particular, the letters `B`, `J`, `O`, `U`, `X`, and `Z`, are not valid abbreviations for standard amino acids.  (We will not use the [ambiguity code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid#Table_of_standard_amino_acid_abbreviations_and_properties), *e.g.* `B` for aspartic acid or asparagine, `Z` for glutamine or glutamic acid, or `X` for any amino acid.)\n",
