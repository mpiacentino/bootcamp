    "Ken Thompson of Bell Labs developed the first shell for UNIX called V6 in 1971. In 1977, Stephen Bourne introduced the Bourne shell (`sh`) which added the ability to invoke scripts (small reusable programs) from within the shell. The Bourne shell remains relevant. In some cases it's still the default root shell. Shortly afterwards, the C shell (`csh`) was developed which made use of a C-like scripting language. `tcsh` is built on `csh` and is still very common. `bash`, the Bourne again shell was developed by Brian Fox to replace the Bourne shell. It adds many useful features to sh and is the default shell on Macs and several Linux distributions. Future versions of Windows will also have `bash`, and Git-Bash uses `bash` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Z shell (`zsh`) combines useful features from a number of shells and is worth checking out. It is my (JB's) shell of choice. Since it usually requires installation, we will stick with `bash`, probably the most commonly used shell, for the bootcamp."

It allows using the arrow up and arrow down keys traverse up or down by line. It also allows scrolling by touchpad or mouse. Since it doesn't require the whole file to be read before displaying the top content, it's ideal for larger files. It also supports searching initiated by \"/\" followed by the query; `shift+G` will go to the end of the file; `gg` to the beginning; and you can specify a line number too by \"`:`\" followed by the line number."
