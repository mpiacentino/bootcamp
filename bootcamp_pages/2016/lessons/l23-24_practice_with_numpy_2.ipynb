    "## Practice 1: Axes with logarithmic scale\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to plot your data with a logarithmic scale. As an example, let's consider the classic genetic switch engineered by Jim Collins and coworkers ([Gardner, et al., *Nature*, **403**, 339, 2000](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v403/n6767/full/403339a0.html)). This genetic switch was incorporated into *E. coli* and is inducible by adjusting the concentration of the lactose analog IPTG. The readout is the fluorescence intensity of GFP.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's load in some data that have the IPTG concentrations and GFP fluorescence intensity. The data are in the file `~/git/data/collins_switch.csv`. Let's look at it."

    "It has two rows of non-data. Then, Column 1 is the IPTG concentration, column 2 is the normalized GFP expression level, and the last column is the standard error of the mean normalized GFP intensity. This gives the error bars, which we will look at in the next exercise. For now, we will just plot IPTG versus normalized GFP intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In looking at the data set, note that there are two entries for [IPTG] = 0.04 mM. At this concentration, the switch happens, and there are two populations of cells, one with high expression of GFP and one with low. The two data points represent these two populations of cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's make a plot of IPTG versus GFP.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Load in the data set using `np.loadtxt()`. Be sure to use the `delimeter=','` and `skiprows=2` kwargs.\n",
    "2. Slice column 0 out of the data and store it as `iptg`.\n",
    "3. Slice column 1 of the data and store it as `gfp`.\n",
    "4. Make a plot of normalized GFP intensity ($y$-axis) versus IPTG concentration ($y$-axis) using `plt.plot()`. These are data, so you should not make the plot as lines. Use the `marker='.'` and `linestyle='none'` kwargs.\n",
    "5. Label your axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have done that, there are some problems with the plot. It is really hard to see the data points with low concentrations of IPTG. In fact, looking at the data set, the concentration of IPTG varies over four orders of magnitude. When you have data like this, it is wise to plot them on a logarithmic scale. There are three functions in `matplotlib.pyplot` that enable you to plot on a log scale.\n",
    "* `plt.loglog()`: Both $x$ and $y$ axes are on a logarithmic scale.\n",

    "For this data set, it is best to have the $x$ axis on a logarithmic scale. Remake the plot you just did with `plt.semilogx()`."

    "4. Label your axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a problem with this plot; it does not have the $x$-axis on a logarithmic scale, and there is no way to set the scale to be logarithmic using the `plt.errorbar()` function. You can set a logarithmic scale after the plot is generated by doing\n",

    "## Practice 3: Computing and plotting a ECDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "We plotted the measured cross-sectional areas of the *C. elegans* eggs from the Harvey and Orbidans paper as histograms. A histogram is a way of approximately representing the *probability distribution function*, or PDF, describing the data. The *cumulative distribution function*, or CDF, contains the same information as the PDF. It's just its integral. Importantly, we can plot the data to show what the CDF looks like, the so-called *empirical cumulative distribution function*, or ECDF, without the binning bias inherent in histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "To plot a cumulative histogram, the $x$-values are the sorted values of the array of data.  The values of the $y$ axis are $y_j = (j+1) / n$, where $n$ is the number of data points and $0 \\le j \\le n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    ">1. Write a function to compute the ECDF. The call signature is `ecdf(data)`. It returns the `x` and `y` values needed to plot the ECDF.\n",
    "    * Compute `x` by sorting the array `data`.\n",
    "    * Compute `y`. Think carefully about how to do this. The two functions you need are `np.arange()` and `len()`.\n",
    "    * Return `x,y`.\n",
    "2. Load in the data sets `xa_high_food.csv` and `xa_low_food.csv`.\n",
    "3. Generate `x` and `y` values for the ECDFs for these data sets.\n",
    "4. Plot the ECDFs got the high food and low food data as dots. That is, use the kwargs `marker='.'` and `linestyle='none'` when you call `plt.plot()`. Note that to add additional plots to a given figure, you just call `plt.plot()` again.\n",
    "5. Be sure to label your axes and add a legend. \"ECDF\" is a reasonable label for your $y$-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I think far too few papers use ECDFs in displaying data. They are far better then histograms. I hope that now you have found them, you will use them in your own research."
