    "Let's say you want to do some work on a repository, but you are not an active collaborator. For example, there could be a useful package a lab at another university put on GitHub for a certain kind of image segmentation that is useful for your research. You want to do something *almost* exactly like the package does, but need to make some small modifications yourself. You want to clone the repository and add a couple functions and maybe modify one or two they already have, using much of the rest of the repository untouched. Of course, you also want to update your local copy of all that untouched (but still used) code when the maintainers update it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is kind of exactly what you want to do here in the Bootcamp. We have a repository that has data sets and a couple tutorials, but you want to write your Python code right in that repository. If I update the data sets, you want to be able to pull in my changes, but still have your code in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nice way to do this called **forking**. To fork a repository on GitHub, simply navigate got the website of the repository and click the Fork button. Be sure you are logged in as yourself when you do this. [Here](https://github.com/justinbois/bootcamp/) is the GitHub page for the bootcamp.\n",

Since you will be editing things going forward in the repository, we will first blow away the `bootcamp` repository you mess around with yesterday in the [command line tutorial](l02_basic_command_line_skills.html). (Only execute the commands below if you didn't put any notes or anything you want to keep in the `~/git/bootcamp/` directory. Otherwise, you will lose it forever.)\n",

The original repository is typically called the **upstream repository**, since presumably you are changing it, so you are downstream. You want the upstream repository to be a **remote** repository, which is just what we call a repository we track and fetch and merge from. To see which repositories are remote, do\n",

    "2. Type `git status` at the command line. What do you see?\n",
    "3. On the command line, do `git diff`. What do you see? The last few lines are most important; they tell you what has changed. `git diff` is very useful. It tells you what local changes you have made to your document since the last commit.\n",
