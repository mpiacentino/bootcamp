We'll have a function `rna()`, which converts a DNA sequence to an RNA sequence (just changes `T` to `U`), and another function `reverse_rna_complement()`, which returns the reverse RNA complement of a DNA template.

This tells Python/IPython where to look for your modules. `conda` takes care of this for you for anything managed with `conda`, but obviously not for your own packages. In the [lesson on command line skills](l02_basic_command_line_skills.html), you set up a directory for your bootcamp files with the path `~/git/bootcamp/`.
